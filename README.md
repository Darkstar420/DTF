## Example Smart Contract

We've added an example smart contract `DTF.sol` This contract showcases how event ticketing can be managed on the blockchain, including creating events, buying tickets, and reselling tickets.

What the Contract Does
The DTFEventTicketing smart contract is designed for the Decentralized Ticketing Fare (DTF) platform, which aims to revolutionize event ticketing using blockchain technology. The contract allows event organizers to create events, set ticket prices, and specify the total number of tickets. Users can purchase tickets for these events, and ticket holders have the ability to sell their tickets back to the organizer or to other users.

Main Features
Event Creation: Event organizers can create events with specific names, ticket prices, and total ticket counts.
Ticket Purchasing: Users can buy tickets for events by paying the specified ticket price. Each ticket is represented as a unique non-fungible token (NFT).
Ticket Reselling: Ticket holders can sell their tickets to other users, with the contract ensuring the transfer of ownership and payment.
Non-Reentrancy Protection: The contract uses the ReentrancyGuard modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks during ticket purchases and sales.
Prerequisites and Dependencies
This contract is written in Solidity and is intended to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain or a compatible network. It depends on the OpenZeppelin Contracts library for secure and standardized implementations of ERC-721 (NFT) functionality and other security features. Make sure to install the OpenZeppelin Contracts library in your project:

shell
Copy code
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
Example Usage
Deploy the Contract: An event organizer deploys the contract to the blockchain.
Create an Event: The organizer creates an event by specifying its name, ticket price, and total number of tickets.
solidity
Copy code
createEvent("Concert XYZ", 0.1 ether, 100);
Buy a Ticket: A user buys a ticket for the event by sending the correct amount of ether to the contract.
solidity
Copy code
buyTicket(eventId);
Sell a Ticket: A ticket holder can sell their ticket to another user by specifying the ticket ID and the buyer's address.
solidity
Copy code
sellTicket(ticketId, buyerAddress);
